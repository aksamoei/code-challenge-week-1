# Code Challenge Week 1
### Description
Code challenge week 1 has three code Javascript files to handle three distinct challenges. The three challenges are:
* Challenge 1: Student grade calculation
* Challenge 2: Speed detector code
* Challenge 3 : Net salary calculation
## Student Grade Calculator
### Description
The student grade calculator takes student marks as inputs, then assigns different grades based on the marks. This calculator assigns grades based on this criteria:
* A > 79
* B - 60 to 79
* C - 59 to 50
* D - 40 to 49
* E - less than 40
For example, if you input 53, the calculator outputs "C".
### Setup Instructions
#### Requirements for Installation
- Chrome browser
- Ubuntu 
- Vs Code
#### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. cd to the local repo (in the terminal(Ubuntu)).
3. Run the command `code gradeCalculator.js` to open the grade calculator in VS code.
4. Copy the code in VS code by using the keyboard shortcuts `Ctrl A` followed by `Ctrl C`. For mac users use `Cmd + A` followed by `Cmd + C`
5. In the terminal run `explorer.exe` to open Chrome. Linux users can run `google-chrome`.
6. Open Chrome's console using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + shift + J`. Mac users can use `Cmd + option + J`.
7. Paste the calculator code in the console. Use `Ctrl + V` for Windows/Linux or `Cmd + V` for mac. 
8. Use the `Enter` or `Return` key to run the grade calculator.
## Speed Detector
The speed detector prints out demerit points to drivers based on a speed limit of 70. Demerit points above 12 trigger the "Licence Suspended" message. Here's what i outputs:
* Speed < 70: "Ok"
* Speed > 70: Points: (1 point for every 5 km/s above 70)
* Points > 12: "License Suspended"
For example, if you input 200, the detector prints out "License Suspended"

## Net Salary Calculator
The net salary calculator calculates and outputs the Net Salary based on the Payee, NHIF, NSSF, and the Gross Salary. The user is prompted for basicSalary and the calculator outputs how much their Net Salary is. This is how it works:
- First, it calculates the NSSF
- Then, it calculates the NHIF
- Then it calculates the PAYEE
- Then it calculates the Gross Salary
- It then outputs the Net Salary by subtracting deductions from the Gross Salary.
